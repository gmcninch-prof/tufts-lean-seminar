# Lean seminar: proving elementary set-theoretic statements 
-/

/- a predicate on a type `α : Type` is just a function
   `P : α → Prop`.
   
   In Mathlib, one speaks of a set as term `S` of type `Set α` for some type α.
   
   For a given term `x : α`, membership in `S` is viewed as a proposition.
   
   Thus `S` is really `{ x | P x }` for some predicate `P : α → Prop`.
   
   For `y : α`, the proposition `y ∈ S` is then defined to be the same as the 
   proposition `P y`.

Theme: a statement about sets is a statement of logic in disguise,
and the outermost connective tells you which tactic to use.

| goal or hypothesis        | tactic                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| goal  `A ⊆ B`, `∀`, `→`   | `intro x hx`                            |
| goal  `A = B` (sets)      | `ext x`, then usually `constructor`     |
| goal  `P ∧ Q`, `P ↔ Q`    | `constructor`  (or `⟨_, _⟩`)            |
| goal  `P ∨ Q`             | `left`  /  `right`                      |
| goal  `∃ x, P x`          | `use a`  (or `⟨a, _⟩`)                  |
| hyp   `h : P ∧ Q`         | `obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h`   (or `h.1`, `h.2`) |
| hyp   `h : P ∨ Q`         | `rcases h with h | h`                   |
| hyp   `h : ∃ x, P x`      | `obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := h`                   |
| goal  `False`-ish, `¬`    | `intro h`  /  `by_contra h`             |

`rintro` combines `intro` and `rcases`, e.g. `rintro x ⟨hA, hB | hC⟩`.

Useful when stuck:
* `show ...` restates the goal in an equivalent (definitionally equal) form.
* `exact?` or `apply?` asks Lean to search for a closing term.
* `simp only [Set.mem_inter_iff]` unfolds membership if you prefer explicit steps.
* `rfl` will sometimes work when both sides unfold to the same thing.

Replace each `sorry` with a proof.  Starred exercises (★) are harder.
Once you have a proof by hand, feel free to see what `aesop` or
`ext x; simp; tauto` do with the same statement.

/-! ## Warm-up: membership is just the predicate -/

example (p : α → Prop) (a : α) : a ∈ {x | p x} ↔ p a := Iff.rfl

example (A B : Set α) (x : α) : x ∈ A ∩ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B := Iff.rfl
